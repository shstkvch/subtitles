1
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:20,843
I REMEMBER

2
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:29,894
The puffballs!

3
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:36,025
"When the puffballs come,
then winter's almost gone."

4
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:46,494
"When the puffballs soar,
then winter is no more."

5
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,581
I've got the best one!

6
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,417
- Ciccio, let's go to the seashore.
- Look at this one!

7
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,480
In our town, the puffballs
arrive hand in hand with spring.

8
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,862
These are the sort of puffballs
that drift around,

9
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:26,617
<i>soaring over the cemetery,
where all rest in peace,</i>

10
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,496
<i>soaring over the beachfront
and over the Germans, newly arrived,</i>

11
00:05:30,579 --> 00:05:33,207
<i>who don't feel the cold.</i>

12
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:37,211
<i>Drifting, drifting...</i>

13
00:05:37,294 --> 00:05:38,754
<i>swirling...</i>

14
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:42,508
<i>swirling... swirling...</i>

15
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:45,678
<i>Drifting, drifting, drifting!</i>

16
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,430
I'm the last of 14 children.

17
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:54,311
By then my father had had enough,
so he called me "Definitive."

18
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:58,691
If he'd had enough sooner,
there'd have been one less chatterer.

19
00:05:58,774 --> 00:06:01,527
- Good evening.
- See you in the square.

20
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:08,075
I've come for my sister. Am I too early?

21
00:06:08,158 --> 00:06:09,785
Your sister's here.

22
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,580
Fiorella, I'm all done. Come in.

23
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:16,125
I better calm you down,
you horny beast. What a body!

24
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:21,130
Excuse me.
The bonfire's bigger this year than last.

25
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,884
You going to the bonfire tonight?
What are you playing?

26
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,844
A brand-new tune I wrote.

27
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,722
Listen to this.

28
00:06:46,196 --> 00:06:50,743
Now, Dad, we'll watch them
light the bonfire, then off to bed.

29
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,828
The doctor says you must go to bed early.

30
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,165
The doctor's an asshole.
I'll go to bed when I want.

31
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,668
Then you'll end up in the hospital,
and this time, I'll leave you there.

32
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:04,673
Blackheads! Numskulls!

33
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,599
Scram! That's my spot!

34
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:18,896
Creeps!

35
00:07:18,979 --> 00:07:21,398
Let me through!

36
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,192
Listen to this one.

37
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,778
One father can take care of 100 kids,

38
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:28,155
but 100 kids
can't take care of one father.

39
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:31,408
- That's the gospel truth.
- I want to set off a firecracker.

40
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,493
Stay here!

41
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:37,581
Hey, Giudizio, catch!

42
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:44,797
I can, I command, I want!
Long live Giudizio!

43
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:51,720
Volpina, have you made love today?

44
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,682
Come on.
How many men did you service?

45
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,104
I bet you even dip a cock
in your morning coffee.

46
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:03,816
Here she comes!

47
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,696
You're the greatest, Gradisca.
Greta Garbo's got nothing on you!

48
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,243
Let's go over there.

49
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,457
Ronald Colman, we're over here!

50
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,045
Giudizio, take this chair too.

51
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,173
Burn this one too. Put it on top.

52
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,884
Set the old witch in it.

53
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,513
I'll stuff that chair down your throat!
Take it back home!

54
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,108
The old witch!

55
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,862
The old witch is here!

56
00:08:49,945 --> 00:08:52,656
Let me marry her before you burn her!

57
00:08:57,244 --> 00:08:58,579
What are you looking at?

58
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,206
I wasn't looking, I swear.

59
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,791
Lay off!

60
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:09,965
Don't look. You'll get too excited.

61
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:25,814
Bring the firecrackers!

62
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,109
Light the bonfire and burn the old witch!

63
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:55,260
"Burn away, O witch so old.
Burn the winter and the cold."

64
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:59,056
Here comes spring!

65
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:02,643
- I don't have a match.
- But your beloved has, my dear.

66
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,820
Burn the old witch!

67
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,948
Long live Giudizio!

68
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:20,119
I can, I command, I want!

69
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,796
- Where's the ladder?
- You want the ladder?

70
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,049
You want it? Take it!

71
00:10:39,346 --> 00:10:43,684
- Take it!
- Give me the ladder! I'm burning up!

72
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:50,899
In America, I saw bonfires 300 feet high.

73
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,069
- When were you ever in America?
- My parents are American.

74
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,198
I'll break your neck!

75
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,784
You should hear what my father
can do with his ass!

76
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,704
Hooray for spring!

77
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,336
- It gives me a funny feeling.
- Yeah, me too.

78
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,631
But winter's dying
and spring is on its way.

79
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,509
I can feel it all over me already!

80
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,095
Our respects, milord. Our respects, ma'am.

81
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,765
- Our respects to you, little countess.
- Thank you.

82
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:12,272
Drink a little. It'll do you good.

83
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,067
Look, even your aunt's drinking.

84
00:12:39,883 --> 00:12:43,387
Good old Lallo!
No one would know you're 60.

85
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,600
Look at that.
Your brother really is an asshole.

86
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,519
He's just a kid.

87
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:57,234
Now watch the Malaysian tiger leap!

88
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,529
Watch it!

89
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:03,365
As soon as we get home
I'll let you have it!

90
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:05,993
- The heel came off.
- Then he'll have to do without one!

91
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,912
Where's that other useless ass gone?

92
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,959
Ciccio, throw the big bang on the fire!

93
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,461
What are you up to? Off to bed with you!

94
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,755
I'll put you all in boarding school!

95
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,806
It's Scureza di Corpolc'), "The Fart."
Go to it, Scureza!

96
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,935
Bravo, Scureza!

97
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:58,128
The origins of this town
are lost in the mists of time.

98
00:13:58,211 --> 00:14:01,673
In the municipal museum,
there are stone implements...

99
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,468
- All the best.
- My respects.

100
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:06,428
...that date to prehistoric times.

101
00:14:06,511 --> 00:14:10,057
I myself have found
some graffiti of great antiquity

102
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,684
in caves on Count Lovignano's estate.

103
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:18,065
Be that as it may, the first date
we know for certain is 268 BC,

104
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:22,569
when this became a Roman colony
and the starting point of the Via Aemilia.

105
00:14:22,652 --> 00:14:23,987
Ml'. Lawyer!

106
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,413
That, too, is characteristic
of the irreverent nature of these people,

107
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:36,625
who bear Roman and Celtic blood
in their veins.

108
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:40,962
Theirs is an exuberant, generous,
loyal and tenacious nature.

109
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,050
The divine Dante, Pascoli, D'Annunzio

110
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:49,388
and many others have lauded this land,

111
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:53,517
and innumerable are its sons
who have contributed greatly

112
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,062
to art, science, religion and politics.

113
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:00,816
Who is that?

114
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,359
You think you're funny,

115
00:15:02,442 --> 00:15:04,569
but you're too cowardly to show your face.

116
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:07,447
Show yourself.

117
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:11,284
Come out here
and I'll teach you a thing or two.

118
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,507
- Mr. Lawyer.
- Yeah, yeah.

119
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,553
Gentlemen!

120
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,514
What is all this?

121
00:15:44,609 --> 00:15:48,905
- Shall we take our places?
- If you insist, Headmaster.

122
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,325
But I never come out well in pictures.

123
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,495
You boys in the back, get up on the bench.

124
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,462
- What is it now, De Santis?
- It wasn't me, sir!

125
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,088
Aldina.

126
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,153
Look, it looks like you.

127
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,655
What's going on?

128
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,282
Gigliozzi!

129
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,451
Take your seat.

130
00:16:34,534 --> 00:16:36,369
Put it down her back.

131
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,957
Hold it like that, please.

132
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,710
Stay Still, like that... Got it!

133
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,962
What is this?

134
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:47,547
A stone.

135
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:49,925
- Yes, but what is it?
- I know.

136
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,761
- It's for a slingshot.
- An elephant's testicle?

137
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,556
I'll tell you. It's a pendulum.

138
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,185
You've certainly all seen
a grandfather clock.

139
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:02,020
And how does it go?

140
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:19,454
Where did Tiberius retire to
upon giving up command of the empire?

141
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,581
Capri.

142
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:33,760
- When was Agrippina killed?
-69 AD.

143
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:39,015
Why did you give me a zero? Wasn't it 69?

144
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,353
It was 59 AD.

145
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,063
Are you sure?

146
00:17:45,146 --> 00:17:48,358
What do you mean, am I sure? It was 59 AD!

147
00:17:48,441 --> 00:17:50,735
Damn it! I knew it!

148
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,613
You'll drive me crazy!
Get back to your seat!

149
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,657
Why couldn't it have been 69?

150
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:03,957
There will come a day

151
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,126
when a renewed Italy

152
00:18:06,209 --> 00:18:08,295
will take to the field of battle
on her own behalf

153
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:11,715
and not to defend her soil for others,
with their weapons.

154
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,636
Being spirit, the Universal
becomes incarnate in the state

155
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,682
and cannot but enter
into the true nature of the church.

156
00:18:20,765 --> 00:18:26,146
But this reconciliation between church
and state came about through a deity

157
00:18:26,229 --> 00:18:29,899
who brought order
to members of church and state,

158
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,611
demanding iron discipline

159
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,614
and the right to intervene
in every aspect of individual life.

160
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,409
He is God's chosen Son

161
00:18:39,492 --> 00:18:42,454
because he has
the same power as the Father.

162
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:45,040
Then there is the Holy Spirit,

163
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:49,794
to be placed on the same level
as the Father and the Son. Is that clear?

164
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,464
That is why God is one and also a trinity.

165
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:58,553
Today we'll speak of the great Giotto.

166
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,388
Whose balls exploded like this!

167
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,058
Do you know, boys and girls,

168
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:06,895
why Giotto is so important
in Italian painting?

169
00:19:08,938 --> 00:19:13,777
I'll tell you:
because he invented perspective.

170
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,032
Per-spec-tive!

171
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:23,244
Teacher, may I leave the room?

172
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,163
Bobo let out a real stinker!

173
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,164
What's that?

174
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,333
You're crazy.

175
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,169
It's not true. I never fart.

176
00:19:31,252 --> 00:19:32,962
- You do too.
- I do not.

177
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:37,133
Alboino...

178
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,555
signed the peace.

179
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:44,391
Gigliozzi, out!

180
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:47,227
This one isn't difficult. Solve it.

181
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,451
Why did you stop? You were doing fine.

182
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,994
What were you trying to do?

183
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,289
- Give me a clue.
- Pass it here.

184
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,625
Just think a moment.

185
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,837
X9 plus the square root of K3.

186
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,924
It's obvious!

187
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:23,513
Move over. What have you done here?

188
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:27,809
We'll go through it together.
What's this here?

189
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,940
What's this here, I said.
You must know how to read.

190
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:36,067
- But I -
- Keep quiet!

191
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:47,829
X9 plus the square root of K3...

192
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,167
There's your answer.

193
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,670
X1 equals 140.

194
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,632
X2 equals three-fifths of the total,
less the difference.

195
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,926
- Is that clear?
- Yes...

196
00:21:05,346 --> 00:21:06,347
What have you done?

197
00:21:07,056 --> 00:21:09,058
Are you crazy?

198
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,019
Janitor!

199
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,287
- Greek is so beautiful, isn't it?
- You betcha.

200
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,872
It's so musical.

201
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,085
<i>Emarpszamen. Repeat after me.</i>

202
00:21:40,006 --> 00:21:41,674
Quiet.

203
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,385
Quiet down, the rest of you. Try it again.

204
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,096
- Teacher, would you be so kind -
- As to what?

205
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,807
Could I hear it again?

206
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,643
Certainly. Listen.

207
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:56,648
Careful with the tongue.

208
00:21:56,731 --> 00:22:00,902
It has to go here, against the palate.

209
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,071
Then spit it out.

210
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,165
Quiet.

211
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:16,751
Try once more.

212
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:26,469
You see? Greek is so difficult.

213
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,346
What did you do with your tongue?

214
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,184
Don't stick it out so far.
Between the teeth.

215
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,563
- Like this?
- That's right.

216
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:43,820
Back to your seat, damn it!

217
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,613
I nearly had it that time.

218
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,076
Who's that?

219
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,661
It's Ciccio.

220
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:56,457
- Leave me have that.
- Just one drag, okay?

221
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:01,129
Is it true Aldina tore up
yet another of your poems?

222
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:02,839
Yeah, but I wrote another one.

223
00:23:02,922 --> 00:23:06,926
"What a kind, gentle maiden
thou art, Aldina.

224
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:12,098
You set my heart beating
like a steam hammer."

225
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:18,521
- It's so nice and warm outside.
- I prefer Aldina's mother.

226
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,149
I wonder who's down
on the beach this morning.

227
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,708
Fu Manchu!

228
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:49,969
Volpina!

229
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,521
Volpina, come here!

230
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,738
What are you doing here?

231
00:24:08,821 --> 00:24:10,198
What do you want here?

232
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,283
I lost my pussycat.

233
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:13,868
Really?

234
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:18,706
There are no cats around here.

235
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,874
Go on home now.

236
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,462
It's hot, isn't it?

237
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,548
Aren't you all hot?

238
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:32,178
She's an odd one, eh?

239
00:24:32,261 --> 00:24:34,138
Be a good girl and run on home.

240
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,057
There are no cats here.

241
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,185
Hey, boss!

242
00:24:39,268 --> 00:24:42,271
Mortar wrote another poem.

243
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,524
When do you manage to write these poems?

244
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:47,777
Mortar, let the boss hear your poem.

245
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,196
Let's hear it.

246
00:24:52,573 --> 00:24:54,409
What's it called?

247
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,703
-"Bricks."
- Good title.

248
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,706
<i>My grandfather made bricks</i>

249
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:02,125
<i>My father made bricks</i>

250
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,335
<i>I make bricks as well</i>

251
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,713
<i>But where's my house?</i>

252
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:14,679
Very true. I get your point.

253
00:25:14,762 --> 00:25:18,016
Quite right.
But I, too, was once a poor man,

254
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,102
and I gradually worked
my way up to master builder.

255
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:24,355
Things don't just fall in your lap.

256
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,650
You have to be patient. You have to work.

257
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,446
With hard work, you can do it.
You have to work.

258
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:33,406
Aren't we working?

259
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,242
That's enough!

260
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,166
No drinking before the soup.

261
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,169
- Not before the soup.
- Is that engraved somewhere?

262
00:25:46,252 --> 00:25:48,588
Your stomach will swell up.
I read it in the paper.

263
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:53,593
- Keep your hands to yourself!
- There's a spoon missing.

264
00:25:53,676 --> 00:25:56,888
- Is it hot, Lallino?
- A little.

265
00:25:58,681 --> 00:26:02,185
- Gimme a lot!
- You'll get your share.

266
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,273
Would you like some more, Lallo?
There's a little left.

267
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:15,573
- Has it got enough salt?
- Yes, Grandpa.

268
00:26:15,656 --> 00:26:18,451
- Gina, give Grandpa a little.
- He's already eaten.

269
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:22,789
My father's father
was known as "Big Meat."

270
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:25,416
He lived to be 107
and he was still doing it!

271
00:26:27,251 --> 00:26:28,920
I can't take anymore.

272
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:32,965
So?

273
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:35,968
- So, when I was little...
- You really liked it?

274
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,678
Wasn't there enough salt?

275
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,181
...he taught me
to eat at 11:00 in the morning,

276
00:26:40,264 --> 00:26:42,558
before the sun burns your head,

277
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,185
and at 4:00 in the afternoon.

278
00:26:44,268 --> 00:26:49,065
Otherwise, food is like poison
that gets into your blood.

279
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,275
Aren't you eating?

280
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,739
What did you do to your mother?

281
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,699
- Nothing.
- Nothing, Dad.

282
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,868
It's nothing they did!

283
00:27:01,327 --> 00:27:02,995
Damn it all!

284
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,166
I get up at 4:00 a.m.
and slave away all day like a mule,

285
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:13,256
and when I come home for a crust of bread,
I find a bunch of long faces!

286
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,553
Now you won't have to look at this one!

287
00:27:19,345 --> 00:27:22,390
Ma'am, it's time
to take the water off the stove.

288
00:27:24,892 --> 00:27:25,893
It's so heavy.

289
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,563
- What's the matter?
- Nothing!

290
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,898
- Then eat something!
- I don't want anything!

291
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,484
- Why not?
- Because I don't!

292
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:36,904
- Shut the door. It's cold.
- Just a minute.

293
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,073
I'm still convalescing.

294
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:45,663
- Who can that be at this hour?
- How would I know!

295
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:48,124
- Shall I go?
- Yes.

296
00:27:51,377 --> 00:27:53,921
You think my fanny's a good-luck charm?

297
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,465
Chicken always gets stuck in my teeth.

298
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,760
Okay if I take a little more, Dad?

299
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,761
Hands off!

300
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,055
- Just a wing.
<i>- I'll</i> do the serving here.

301
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:06,601
Tell me, Miranda:
Did you put mint in this?

302
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:10,479
What do you mean, mint? It's sage.

303
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:14,275
But you noticed something
was different, didn't you?

304
00:28:14,358 --> 00:28:16,736
- Lallino has a sensitive palate.
- Very much so.

305
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:19,238
Gina! Who is it?

306
00:28:23,492 --> 00:28:26,162
- Well?
- It's Mr. Biondi.

307
00:28:26,245 --> 00:28:30,208
- Right when I'm eating!
-Isn't he the bishop's cousin?

308
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:32,418
Are you bottomless pits or what?

309
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:34,378
Anyone would think I never fed you!

310
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:39,592
- Uncle, watch.
- If your dad sees you!

311
00:28:40,801 --> 00:28:43,638
Uncle, do that trick for us.

312
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:45,473
Come on, just once.

313
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:48,059
Look, Titta!

314
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,146
Bravo!

315
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,899
-İsn't that hard, Uncle?
- Well, you know...

316
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,915
Good wine, this Sangiovese.

317
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,586
By the way, where were you last night?

318
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,464
Me? At the movies.
At the Cinema Fulgor.

319
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:19,966
And what was showing?

320
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:26,597
Uncle, the Americans were trying
to enter Comanche territory.

321
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,641
They built a bridge for the railroad,

322
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,560
but the Indians shot arrows at them.

323
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,646
It was a massacre!

324
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:35,481
I'll massacre you, you little hooligan!

325
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:37,650
What's going on?

326
00:29:38,192 --> 00:29:42,196
- I didn't do anything!
- Aurelio, leave him alone!

327
00:29:43,197 --> 00:29:47,368
- I'll put you in the hospital!
- People are watching.

328
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,208
Starting tomorrow, no more school,
no more allowance!

329
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,460
He can start working with me!

330
00:29:56,544 --> 00:30:00,548
- And how will you pay me?
- With a hammer in the face!

331
00:30:00,631 --> 00:30:03,968
You have to tell me
who fathered this piece of shit!

332
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,887
At his age, I'd already
been working for three years!

333
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,641
Right, and you gave
all your money to Grandma!

334
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,685
That's enough now! Come in and eat!

335
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,770
Hello.

336
00:30:18,065 --> 00:30:20,860
Everyone in town laughs at us,
even the roosters.

337
00:30:22,653 --> 00:30:25,323
This is my house, and I'll do as I please!

338
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,450
Listen to His Royal Highness!

339
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,369
Give me your brother's plate.

340
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,621
Give me your brother's plate!

341
00:30:33,247 --> 00:30:36,792
- Where are you going with that?
- What did he do?

342
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,129
What did he do? I'll show you what he did!

343
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:41,756
What did he do?

344
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:48,220
- What did your brother do? Speak up!
- I don't know!

345
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,849
This is Mr. Biondi's hat.
He was at the movies last night.

346
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:55,269
Just smell it. Know who did that?

347
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,605
That delinquent son of yours.

348
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:01,442
He pissed over the balcony rail,
right on Biondi's head.

349
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,235
It cost me three bills!

350
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:06,739
I'm sure it was those juvenile delinquents
he hangs around with!

351
00:31:06,822 --> 00:31:09,575
Enough!

352
00:31:09,658 --> 00:31:13,079
Stop taking his side!
He's getting worse and worse!

353
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:18,084
They're a pair of little hoodlums!
You've brought them up wrong!

354
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:22,922
Then you do it. Let's see how well you do!

355
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,300
I can't stand any more! I'm going crazy!

356
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,761
I'm going mad!

357
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:32,056
I'll kill you all.
I'll kill the whole lot of you!

358
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:39,355
I'll put strychnine in your soup!

359
00:31:39,438 --> 00:31:42,775
That's what I'll do one of these days!

360
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,027
You wouldn't dare!

361
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:46,946
You bet I would.

362
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,739
One, two, three...

363
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:56,539
- But I'll kill myself first!
- Good.

364
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,125
- Right now!
- Go ahead.

365
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,838
You'll see! I'll kill myself first!

366
00:32:05,631 --> 00:32:07,716
Uncle, look at Dad!

367
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:20,938
Why do these things happen to me?
What have I done?

368
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:34,660
Goddamn it all!

369
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,707
- Did you hurt yourself?
- What are you doing on the floor?

370
00:33:02,813 --> 00:33:04,440
Evening, Headmaster.

371
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,572
- There's Gradisca!
- Where?

372
00:33:12,364 --> 00:33:13,365
Down there!

373
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:32,051
If you give the archbishop permission
to sell holy images in the schools,

374
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,720
I'm sure there'll be no need to...

375
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,736
<i>When</i> are <i>you showing
The Vale of Love with</i> Gary <i>Cooper?</i>

376
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:52,988
Next week, my dear.

377
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:54,198
Thank you.

378
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:57,284
When can your little prince
come to bed with you?

379
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,496
You'll get my purse over your head!

380
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,541
Such behavior!

381
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,254
Get lost, Giudizio.

382
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,631
It was beautiful! I had a good cry.

383
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:14,593
Romanesque, 13th century,
perfectly preserved.

384
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,102
Mullion windows.
Excuse me. I'll continue later.

385
00:34:23,852 --> 00:34:28,399
Lallo, read the telegram
"White Feather" got from Stockholm.

386
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:33,112
"Come immediately.
Cannot live without you. lnge."

387
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:36,156
Is she the bucktoothed one
from last summer?

388
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,741
Are you going?

389
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,827
It'll be damned cold up there now!

390
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:49,253
İf I shot them, they'd call me a murderer.

391
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:51,422
I'll throw them all in a pit of lime!

392
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:58,387
Get the hell out of here!

393
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:03,058
I couldn't leave Mama behind
for those buck teeth.

394
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,478
Look at Madam's new girls.

395
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:12,026
Hey, look!

396
00:35:21,493 --> 00:35:23,495
See the big one with the hood?

397
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,043
Here I am!

398
00:35:30,085 --> 00:35:31,211
Me too!

399
00:35:35,841 --> 00:35:38,594
It's my God-given right to...

400
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,598
A lovely man. A lot like Wallace Beery.

401
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:45,809
With that beard,
he looked like a French duke.

402
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,997
That's some cargo!

403
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,931
Good night, King Vittorio.
Good night, everybody.

404
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:09,810
<i>This is the Victory Monument.</i>

405
00:37:09,893 --> 00:37:11,895
<i>We used to visit it every day.</i>

406
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,772
<i>And I dreamed about it at night, too.</i>

407
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,155
- I'm going, Mama.
- Make a good confession.

408
00:37:21,238 --> 00:37:23,782
If you've had anything to drink,
you can't receive communion.

409
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,910
You can drink water.
You just can't eat anything.

410
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,829
Not even water.

411
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:31,123
And tell him that you're a delinquent,

412
00:37:31,206 --> 00:37:35,085
that you upset your mother and father,
and that you answer back.

413
00:37:36,044 --> 00:37:39,381
And that you curse everything, understand?

414
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,591
Everything!

415
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:46,555
Who's first?

416
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,698
- How long since your last confession?
- Christmas.

417
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:09,161
- My God! Mass on days of obligation?
- Except when I had the mumps.

418
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:12,164
- Do you honor your father and mother?
- Yes.

419
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:14,416
No, not like that!

420
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:18,253
- White on one side, yellow on the other.
- What's the difference?

421
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,090
- It's a question of aesthetics.
- Fine.

422
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,636
Now then, do you honor
your father and mother?

423
00:38:25,719 --> 00:38:30,057
Yes, but they don't honor me.
They beat me.

424
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:34,311
- You must annoy them. Do you tell lies?
- I have to.

425
00:38:34,394 --> 00:38:36,522
- Do you covet others' goods?
- Yes...

426
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,316
The small flowers go in the small vases.

427
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,777
What did you say you covet?

428
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,906
My pal Bragger's got a raincoat
with metal buckles

429
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:49,201
like the detective's
in the William Powell-Myrna Loy films.

430
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,871
Do you commit impure acts?
Do you touch yourself?

431
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,874
Do you know St. Louis weeps
when you touch yourself?

432
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,839
<i>Let him weep.</i>

433
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,217
<i>I'm not gonna tell you.
You'll only tell Dad.</i>

434
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,678
<i>Don't tell me you don't touch yourself.</i>

435
00:39:08,178 --> 00:39:11,807
<i>How can you not, when you see
the woman in the tobacco shop,</i>

436
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:15,185
<i>as stacked as she is, and she says...</i>

437
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,937
Export brand?

438
00:39:18,605 --> 00:39:22,442
<i>And the math teacher
who looks just like a lion .7</i>

439
00:39:23,026 --> 00:39:24,987
<i>Mother of God!</i>

440
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:28,699
<i>How can you avoid touching yourself
when she looks at you that way?</i>

441
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:33,662
<i>What do you think we come
to see on Si. Anthonyis day,</i>

442
00:39:33,745 --> 00:39:36,623
<i>when they bless the animals?
The sheep's butts?</i>

443
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,982
<i>See how he's looking at me?</i>

444
00:40:02,065 --> 00:40:04,443
<i>How can I tell him about Volpina</i>

445
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:07,529
<i>and the time I pumped up
her bicycle tires?</i>

446
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,120
I didn't know people kissed like that.
Did you?

447
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:16,538
With their tongues going in and out?

448
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,625
I'll ask the questions here.
Not you. Go on.

449
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,126
<i>Then there's Gradisca.</i>

450
00:40:22,085 --> 00:40:26,715
<i>Last summer, I saw her going
into the movie theater.</i>

451
00:40:26,798 --> 00:40:28,926
<i>It's not - you see -</i>

452
00:40:29,676 --> 00:40:32,387
<i>I'm crazy about Gradisca.</i>

453
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,972
<i>I want a wife just like her.</i>

454
00:40:38,393 --> 00:40:39,853
<i>She was alone.</i>

455
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:43,398
<i>There, right before my eyes.</i>

456
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:52,658
<i>I changed seats.</i>

457
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,330
<i>I changed seats again...</i>

458
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,919
<i>and again.</i>

459
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,218
<i>And finally...</i>

460
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:37,869
Looking for something?

461
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,664
<i>I sat there like an asshole.</i>

462
00:41:40,747 --> 00:41:42,833
<i>I could have jumped in the harbor.</i>

463
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,336
<i>Father Balosa
can't understand these things.</i>

464
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,714
<i>But since I had to say something,</i>

465
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:52,843
<i>I said I'd touched myself once,
just a little,</i>

466
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:54,678
<i>but that I regretted it immediately.</i>

467
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,431
<i>He was happy with that.</i>

468
00:41:57,514 --> 00:42:01,018
<i>He told me to say three Our Fathers,
Hail Marys and Glories, and that was it.</i>

469
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,231
You're absolved. Three Our Fathers,
Hail Marys and Glorias.

470
00:42:12,946 --> 00:42:14,823
Do you touch yourself?

471
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:16,950
Just look at those rings under your eyes.

472
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,369
You obviously do.

473
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,456
Yes. Just once, in the garage

474
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,542
- Quit it!
- What?

475
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,210
Always touching me.

476
00:42:32,507 --> 00:42:35,343
- Jean Harlow!
- Gradisca!

477
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:37,929
The tobacco lady's tits!

478
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,598
- The girl at the circus!
- Which one?

479
00:42:39,681 --> 00:42:41,516
With the fishnet stockings.

480
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,268
Aldina!

481
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:45,854
No, Aldina's mine! I'll smack your face!

482
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,875
Platoon, attention!

483
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,119
There he is!

484
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:17,195
Comrades!

485
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,531
<i>Hail Il Duce!</i>

486
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:24,911
We hail Il Duce with grateful hearts
and the Fascist salute!

487
00:44:26,621 --> 00:44:29,916
The greeting of Imperial Rome

488
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,377
that shows us...

489
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,756
the path of destiny
that Fascist Italy must follow.

490
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:58,778
Let me touch him! I want to touch him!

491
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,115
Long live Il Duce!

492
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:31,144
Ninety-nine percent of the population
are party members.

493
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:36,149
We have 1,200 Young Fascist boys
and 3,000 Young Fascist girls.

494
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,068
Our Fascist hearts beat as one,

495
00:45:38,151 --> 00:45:40,528
but the work
on the maritime front needs attention.

496
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:44,032
This marvelous enthusiasm
makes us young

497
00:45:44,115 --> 00:45:46,409
and yet so old at the same time.

498
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:49,955
Young, because Fascism
has rejuvenated our blood

499
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:52,415
with glowing ideals from ancient times.

500
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,836
All I can say is
Mussolini's got two balls this big!

501
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:03,510
Today, April 21st, we celebrate
the birth of Rome, the Eternal City.

502
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:07,430
What does that mean?
That we must respect the monuments,

503
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:10,725
the ruins that Rome has left us,

504
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:15,772
which is what I've done all along,
despite being razzed at night.

505
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:30,537
Do we not see,
on this glorious, sun-filled day,

506
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,707
that the Italian sun, forever free,

507
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,293
is a divine sign
that the heavens are on our side?

508
00:46:37,168 --> 00:46:38,378
Miranda.

509
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:44,217
- Who locked the gate?
- I did.

510
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,927
- Why?
- You know why.

511
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,637
Unlock it.

512
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:50,849
You've heard what's been going on
in the piazza all day.

513
00:46:50,932 --> 00:46:54,602
- Open up. I have business to take care of.
- Nothing doing.

514
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:57,397
You're staying at home.
What's all this stuff?

515
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,482
If I wanted to be a widow,
I'd kill you myself.

516
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,901
I'll strangle you with your neckerchief!

517
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,947
Think I'm scared
of those black-shirted lice?

518
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,407
Give me the key.

519
00:47:09,617 --> 00:47:12,412
Miranda! Damn it all!

520
00:47:12,495 --> 00:47:18,543
Why is it that whenever there's a rally,

521
00:47:18,626 --> 00:47:22,005
I have to stay home?
This is the last straw!

522
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:25,592
One, two, three, four...

523
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,103
These youth are sturdy as rock.

524
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,606
Yes, sturdy as rock.

525
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,901
One, two...

526
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,374
<i>Hail Il Duce!</i>

527
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,811
<i>Young Fascist Ciccio Marconi,</i>

528
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:23,608
<i>do you wish to marry
Young Fascist Aldina Cordini?</i>

529
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:28,530
And you, Young Fascist Aldina Cordini,

530
00:48:28,613 --> 00:48:33,868
do you wish to marry
Young Fascist Ciccio Marconi?

531
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,203
Bravo, Ciccio!

532
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:57,725
Comrades, they speak of "bread and work,"

533
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:01,438
but wouldn't "bread and wine" be better?

534
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,823
- Fernet.
- Coffee.

535
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,908
Just a soft drink.

536
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,870
Three cheers for our comrade!

537
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:29,132
- Difficult shot.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

538
00:49:29,799 --> 00:49:32,343
- Difficult shot.
-Indeed, Your Excellency.

539
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:47,233
I wouldn't like to go up against him.

540
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,912
- Who killed the lights?
- Attilio, light a candle.

541
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:00,079
Light a candle!

542
00:50:02,373 --> 00:50:05,001
There's a phonograph up above.

543
00:50:07,712 --> 00:50:09,214
What are you saying?

544
00:50:11,382 --> 00:50:12,550
Silence!

545
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:17,096
- That's the "lnternationale"!
- What's that?

546
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,806
The anthem of subversives.

547
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,642
Where's it coming from?

548
00:50:20,725 --> 00:50:22,310
Where are you hiding, you scoundrel?

549
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,687
Incredible!

550
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:29,859
Show yourself, coward! Show yourself!

551
00:50:33,863 --> 00:50:35,365
We await your orders, sir!

552
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,953
Everyone is to go home!

553
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,540
And close your windows!

554
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,836
Get inside, you!

555
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,964
Go home! Go!

556
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:56,886
What are you doing there? Go home!

557
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:16,281
Hey! He's up there!

558
00:51:16,906 --> 00:51:19,576
Come home now!

559
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,578
Up in the bell tower!

560
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:05,079
<i>To arms, to arms</i>

561
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,123
<i>We are Fascists</i>

562
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,250
<i>We fight the Communists</i>

563
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:19,802
GOD - COUNTRY - FAMILY

564
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,616
You're free to go.

565
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,701
You can go home.

566
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:47,413
You see? We Fascists aren't all that bad.

567
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,501
We didn't harm a single hair on your head.

568
00:52:52,001 --> 00:52:55,296
More like a cozy little kaffeeklatsch.

569
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,256
Good night, sonny boy.

570
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,761
Bring him here.

571
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,860
Take off your hat.

572
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:21,948
Sorry, it's a habit. Even at home.

573
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,784
Why don't you give the Roman salute?

574
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,455
I didn't know it was mandatory.

575
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,541
I know nothing about politics.

576
00:53:32,458 --> 00:53:33,751
Sit down.

577
00:53:34,919 --> 00:53:37,130
So you know nothing about politics.

578
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,259
Yet you've been heard to say,

579
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:45,471
"if Mussolini keeps on like this,
I really don't know."

580
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,059
What did you mean by
"I really don't know"?

581
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,272
I never said anything like that.

582
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:56,899
I generally only talk about my work.

583
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:01,904
Perhaps I said,
"I really don't know how politics work."

584
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,239
Was it a threat?

585
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,199
Certainly not.

586
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,995
- Lack of faith in Fascism?
- No. Why?

587
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:13,249
- Or perhaps subversive propaganda?
- No, I'd have no reason.

588
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:20,256
And you know nothing
about the phonograph either?

589
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,761
- Phonograph?
- Don't get smart! Answer!

590
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:29,599
I was asleep. These guys woke me up.

591
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:32,185
I didn't even have time to put on my tie.

592
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,774
Your tie...
or your anarchist's neckerchief?

593
00:54:39,108 --> 00:54:40,818
What neckerchief?

594
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:49,660
Would you like to drink a toast
to the triumph of Fascism?

595
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,956
Really, at this hour -

596
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,250
At this hour!

597
00:54:58,419 --> 00:55:02,465
You fools! Trying our patience like this!

598
00:55:02,548 --> 00:55:06,552
You must drink
to a Fascist victory, my friend.

599
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:09,055
Don't make us crack
your skulls open to convince you

600
00:55:09,138 --> 00:55:12,767
that Fascism is
for your protection and dignity!

601
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:15,102
To hell with you

602
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,938
-ignorant bunch of animals!
- Drink.

603
00:55:20,691 --> 00:55:22,985
- This is castor oil.
- Drink it.

604
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:27,240
No. Why should I? What did I do?

605
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,994
What are you doing? Let me go!

606
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:34,705
What are you doing? Why -

607
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,792
Be a good boy, now. Open your mouth.

608
00:55:37,875 --> 00:55:41,963
Open up. Don't make me angry.

609
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:44,549
Drink up. It'll do you good. Drink!

610
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:47,301
Just look at him, a man of his age.

611
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,679
He's a disgrace!

612
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,349
You vomiting on my shoes?

613
00:55:54,725 --> 00:55:56,936
This is what saddens us.

614
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:01,440
This utter refusal to understand.

615
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,650
Why?

616
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,486
Why?

617
00:56:06,153 --> 00:56:08,531
There must be something wrong
with your head.

618
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:11,909
Have some more.
It'll clear up those ideas of yours.

619
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:15,496
- You'll pay for this.
- Send us the bill.

620
00:56:17,331 --> 00:56:19,083
Good heavens, 2:00.

621
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,755
Aurelio!

622
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,014
What happened?

623
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:03,169
You won't listen to me.

624
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:06,213
You'll see.

625
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:16,641
Stand up.

626
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,146
Dry yourself off.

627
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:28,235
Don't catch cold.

628
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,951
Dad!

629
00:57:36,702 --> 00:57:37,954
Go to bed!

630
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,873
God, he stinks!

631
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:48,547
If the person who squealed
is who I think it was,

632
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,550
he'd better move to another continent

633
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,261
or I'll eat his guts out!

634
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,930
I'll have his balls for dinner!

635
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,767
Traitorous son of a bitch!

636
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,899
The Grand Hotel.

637
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:10,736
I call her "the Old Lady."

638
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:15,449
I come here every year
to sip the nectar of love.

639
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,120
I offer tenderness
and yearn for tenderness in return.

640
00:58:19,203 --> 00:58:22,123
I'm the only one in town
who visits the Grand Hotel.

641
00:58:22,206 --> 00:58:24,375
They say Gradisca was here once,

642
00:58:24,458 --> 00:58:28,587
and it was because of
that highly improbable adventure

643
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,674
that she came to be called Gradisca.

644
00:58:31,757 --> 00:58:33,801
Her real name is Ninola.

645
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:36,721
But one winter night three years ago...

646
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:39,223
Don't let us down, Ninola.

647
00:58:39,306 --> 00:58:41,851
The prince is a handsome man.

648
00:58:41,934 --> 00:58:47,106
If he looks satisfied,
mention the work on the harbor.

649
00:58:47,189 --> 00:58:49,775
One word from him is all it would take.

650
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:52,319
Be polite. Speak proper Italian.

651
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:55,448
He's a real prince,
not just any old asshole.

652
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:58,576
Besides, it's a great opportunity
for you, too.

653
00:58:58,659 --> 00:59:00,411
The harbor.

654
01:02:22,446 --> 01:02:24,406
Mr. Prince, sir...

655
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,077
grad/sea! (Whatever you desire)

656
01:02:29,745 --> 01:02:32,790
And that's how Ninola
came to be called Gradisca.

657
01:02:32,873 --> 01:02:35,709
Mind you, I don't attribute
much truth to that story,

658
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:38,837
nor to the one that Biscein tells.

659
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,925
He's a born liar.
He makes up a new one every day.

660
01:02:43,008 --> 01:02:45,386
A couple of years back,

661
01:02:45,469 --> 01:02:48,305
an emir arrived with his 30 concubines.

662
01:02:48,389 --> 01:02:50,766
I saw him arrive.

663
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:41,585
Every night, the emir
locked up tight all 30 rooms.

664
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:43,128
That much is true.

665
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:47,091
It's the rest of Biscein's story
that leaks like a sieve.

666
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:54,098
<i>The silly man claims
that on that very night. .</i> .

667
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,809
Beans, olives, toasted melon seeds!

668
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:23,502
I'm coming, girls!

669
01:05:27,047 --> 01:05:28,674
Come on, Biscein.

670
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:39,268
Sweet Jesus, the pussy!

671
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:34,406
One, two, three, four...

672
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,203
<i>He claims that, between
the beautiful girls and the ugly ones,</i>

673
01:06:39,286 --> 01:06:41,747
<i>he polished off 28 of them that night.</i>

674
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:48,795
Uncle!

675
01:06:52,883 --> 01:06:57,596
Are you Polish? Only Polish women
have that fire in their eyes.

676
01:06:59,556 --> 01:07:00,974
Uncle's a great dancer!

677
01:07:15,072 --> 01:07:17,699
Commandant... ladies...

678
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,537
Then you must be Czech,

679
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:24,331
because only Czech women
have that fire in their eyes.

680
01:07:24,414 --> 01:07:28,001
<i>I know Italian: bellissima, buona sera,</i>

681
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,878
<i>Michelangelo, fanculo,</i>

682
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,380
<i>0 sole mio.</i>

683
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:50,899
Good evening.

684
01:08:08,208 --> 01:08:10,627
- Uncle!
- Get out of here!

685
01:08:11,169 --> 01:08:12,796
Jesus, the asshole waiter!

686
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:35,986
You see sea?

687
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:39,656
You take walk with me. Down there. Come.

688
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:49,416
Leopardi wrote poetry.
Do you know Leopardi?

689
01:08:49,499 --> 01:08:52,002
No, this is my first time here.

690
01:08:54,087 --> 01:08:56,131
Dante Alighieri here.

691
01:08:56,214 --> 01:08:57,758
Leopardi here,

692
01:08:57,841 --> 01:08:59,509
or even here.

693
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:01,219
Oh, good!

694
01:09:20,697 --> 01:09:22,115
How did it go?

695
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,617
How do you think?

696
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,411
I always find German women
to be pushovers.

697
01:09:27,245 --> 01:09:29,498
She's really fallen for me.

698
01:09:30,415 --> 01:09:34,628
And to prove it, she even
offered me posterior intimacy.

699
01:09:58,276 --> 01:10:00,320
Uncle!

700
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:04,032
<i>Uncle Tea was Dad is brother.</i>

701
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:07,285
<i>We took him out for a ride
once a month in the summer.</i>

702
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:09,371
Uncle! He's coming, Dad.

703
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,088
Here he comes.

704
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,054
- Hello, Uncle.
- Come along.

705
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,848
How are things, Teo?

706
01:10:27,931 --> 01:10:29,474
He's happy, Mama.

707
01:10:31,226 --> 01:10:34,020
- He's looking well.
- Yes, he is.

708
01:10:36,022 --> 01:10:37,482
Watch your step.

709
01:10:38,024 --> 01:10:40,527
- Here he is.
- Hello, Uncle.

710
01:10:41,778 --> 01:10:43,405
- How are you?
- And how are you?

711
01:10:43,488 --> 01:10:45,741
I'm fine. I go to school.

712
01:10:48,368 --> 01:10:52,748
We're taking you to the farm
for some passatelli.

713
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:56,251
What do you think of that?

714
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:58,670
Look, Dad's here too.

715
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:02,883
My boy! Give your dad a kiss.

716
01:11:04,259 --> 01:11:05,969
- He's doing better.
- He's okay.

717
01:11:06,928 --> 01:11:09,055
He's grown, hasn't he?
He's in the fifth grade.

718
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:10,599
Teo, how are you?

719
01:11:10,682 --> 01:11:14,060
And that one got dead drunk
the other night.

720
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:17,731
- Teo, how are things?
- I'm much better.

721
01:11:17,814 --> 01:11:19,566
- Mama, the pastries.
- They're right here.

722
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:23,028
Uncle, Mama brought you some pastries.

723
01:11:23,653 --> 01:11:25,572
We'll be back before evening.

724
01:11:26,323 --> 01:11:29,201
- Here, have a smoke on me.
- Thanks.

725
01:11:29,826 --> 01:11:31,536
Sit here next to Dad.

726
01:11:35,373 --> 01:11:37,292
Is Father Pazzaglia still alive?

727
01:11:37,918 --> 01:11:40,045
He's been dead ten years now.

728
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,464
He's been gone quite some time.

729
01:11:42,547 --> 01:11:45,926
- But he was alive last year.
- That was Father Amedeo.

730
01:11:47,928 --> 01:11:49,679
Is he dead too?

731
01:11:49,763 --> 01:11:51,890
No, he's alive.

732
01:11:51,973 --> 01:11:53,809
Exactly. That's what I was saying.

733
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:59,064
I saw him last year,
walking along with a bunch of flowers.

734
01:11:59,147 --> 01:12:00,816
I wonder where he was going.

735
01:12:05,028 --> 01:12:08,031
Teo was a bright lad when he was eight.

736
01:12:09,324 --> 01:12:11,451
No offense, Aurelio,

737
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:16,122
but Teo was much smarter
than you in school.

738
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:19,417
I grant you that. That's quite true.

739
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,336
He still is, even now.

740
01:12:21,419 --> 01:12:23,463
You like being with us, Teo?

741
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:28,343
Uncle, the sea's over there,
like a blue streak.

742
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:31,721
Dad, can I drive the horse?

743
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:35,559
Come on, I'm just sitting here!
Let me drive it!

744
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:39,479
That'd be the first time
a mule ever drove a horse!

745
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:44,442
That road is shorter.

746
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:48,822
That's an awful road, full of potholes
big enough to swallow up our carriage.

747
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:52,367
- Is something wrong?
- His pocket.

748
01:12:56,746 --> 01:12:59,875
Why do you carry those in your pocket?

749
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:04,129
These stones?

750
01:13:06,798 --> 01:13:10,218
- Aren't they heavy?
- Stones are beautiful.

751
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:18,101
Stop the carriage.

752
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:21,396
- What is it?
- Teo needs to take a leak.

753
01:13:22,397 --> 01:13:23,773
If he has to...

754
01:13:26,776 --> 01:13:28,361
Watch your step getting down.

755
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,617
- You too?
- What of it?

756
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,036
Don't be long, Grandpa. I'm hungry.

757
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:39,664
My father's father used to say,

758
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:43,335
"To be fit as a fiddle,
you have to piddle.

759
01:13:43,418 --> 01:13:47,422
To be fit as a frog, pee like a dog."

760
01:13:47,505 --> 01:13:49,382
What a beautiful green, Teo!

761
01:13:54,387 --> 01:13:57,933
- Nice mare. How old is she?
- Three years and two months.

762
01:13:58,016 --> 01:14:00,852
She's got just one bad habit:
She can't stand train whistles.

763
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,062
Oh, yeah?

764
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:07,442
When I'm waiting my turn at the station,
it's really a job to hold her!

765
01:14:07,525 --> 01:14:10,612
- What'll you give her to eat today?
- Some cappelletti.

766
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:12,822
You forgot to unbutton your fly.

767
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:15,158
Uncle pissed in his pants!

768
01:14:17,994 --> 01:14:19,537
And they said he was okay!

769
01:14:20,121 --> 01:14:22,749
You didn't undo your fly.

770
01:14:23,708 --> 01:14:26,294
He forgot.

771
01:14:26,378 --> 01:14:27,963
It's true.

772
01:14:28,046 --> 01:14:31,466
The sea looks like a blue streak.

773
01:14:31,549 --> 01:14:32,968
Uncle, you pissed in your pants!

774
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,886
Shut up!

775
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:37,097
He didn't open the barn doors.

776
01:14:37,931 --> 01:14:40,934
No matter. You can change at the farm.

777
01:14:45,563 --> 01:14:48,608
Come here, or I'll throw myself
under the wheels!

778
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:51,403
Sit down, you little hoodlum!

779
01:14:51,486 --> 01:14:53,405
Shall we move on?

780
01:14:53,488 --> 01:14:54,906
<i>GO , gm!</i>

781
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:08,086
Another fine meal.

782
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:10,755
You all go and see the spring.

783
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:14,759
My son Teo and I will stay here
and have another glass of wine.

784
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:18,555
Fine, but just one.

785
01:15:18,638 --> 01:15:20,348
Know what I'm gonna do?

786
01:15:21,057 --> 01:15:22,851
Take a nap.

787
01:15:24,602 --> 01:15:26,980
Good. It'll be nice here in the shade.

788
01:15:27,981 --> 01:15:30,108
The egg's lovely, isn't it, Teo?

789
01:15:30,775 --> 01:15:32,193
I'm like that too.

790
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:36,281
I can stare at an egg for hours,

791
01:15:36,364 --> 01:15:40,952
wondering how nature
can make things so perfect.

792
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:45,248
'Cause it was God who made nature,
not an ignoramus like you!

793
01:15:45,331 --> 01:15:47,500
On, lay off.

794
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:49,002
See you back here later.

795
01:15:49,085 --> 01:15:50,962
Keep your eye on him, Dad.

796
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,631
Menghino, how far away is this spring?

797
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:04,100
Uncle, look. I'm hypnotizing it.

798
01:16:10,148 --> 01:16:11,316
Oliva!

799
01:16:14,277 --> 01:16:17,906
Oliva, there's a toad here
that looks like Father Balosa.

800
01:16:26,289 --> 01:16:28,500
- How is it?
- Fantastic.

801
01:16:28,583 --> 01:16:30,335
And it won't give you a hangover.

802
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:33,088
- We'll set this here.
- Good thinking.

803
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:40,678
Get that away from there!

804
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:43,014
Naughty boy!

805
01:16:46,768 --> 01:16:48,770
I know your name, you delinquent!

806
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:54,859
- Dad!
- What?

807
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,987
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

808
01:16:58,571 --> 01:17:02,033
- What's he shouting?
- I didn't understand.

809
01:17:02,492 --> 01:17:05,829
Uncle Teo's up a tree!

810
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:11,918
I want a woman!

811
01:17:13,545 --> 01:17:17,132
I want a woman!

812
01:17:22,554 --> 01:17:25,557
Where am I going
to find you a woman, my boy?

813
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,434
- Grandpa, what is it?
- Your uncle's up there.

814
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,354
I want a woman!

815
01:17:31,437 --> 01:17:33,273
He's up there!

816
01:17:35,859 --> 01:17:39,028
Come down, Teo, or you'll hurt yourself.

817
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:41,573
What are you doing? Go get a ladder!

818
01:17:41,656 --> 01:17:45,535
Is this how you keep an eye on him?
How did he get up there?

819
01:17:45,618 --> 01:17:47,036
Dad, I'll go up and get him.

820
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,998
I'm gonna pound you into the ground!

821
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:53,001
I want a woman!

822
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:57,964
How did he get up there?
If he falls, he'll break his neck.

823
01:17:58,047 --> 01:18:02,218
- Go inside and stop being dramatic!
- Dramatic?

824
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:03,720
How did this happen?

825
01:18:03,803 --> 01:18:07,765
We were having a drink, and suddenly -

826
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:10,018
Mr. Aurelio,
he climbed up there like a cat.

827
01:18:10,101 --> 01:18:13,521
Teo, what are you doing?
Are you throwing stones at your old dad?

828
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:16,774
Get down here! That's enough, now!

829
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:22,155
Aurelio, don't you go crazy on me too!

830
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:27,202
- Teo, you've upset your brother.
- Come down, now!

831
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:31,289
I want a woman!

832
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:35,668
Quite a normal urge, actually.
He's 42 years old.

833
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:37,170
Yeah, but he's gonna fall.

834
01:18:37,253 --> 01:18:39,797
When I was 42...

835
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,635
I'm telling you.

836
01:18:43,718 --> 01:18:46,054
That's enough! Come down!

837
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:47,972
Come down, Teo!

838
01:18:55,146 --> 01:18:58,191
Good shot, Uncle! Right in the head!

839
01:18:59,609 --> 01:19:01,152
My head!

840
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:04,989
I'm coming up now.
Don't throw anything at me.

841
01:19:06,115 --> 01:19:08,034
We'll take some birds home -

842
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:12,664
- You want to kill us all?
- I'm going up there.

843
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:15,083
Yes, sirree!

844
01:19:15,166 --> 01:19:17,961
Throw one at me and you'll hear about it!

845
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:22,674
What a shot!

846
01:19:22,757 --> 01:19:26,886
Bastard! I hope somebody
kicks you in the nuts!

847
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:29,639
I want a woman!

848
01:19:29,722 --> 01:19:34,769
Christ, what'll I do now? Jerk off?

849
01:19:38,189 --> 01:19:41,567
I'm an asshole, a stupid asshole!

850
01:19:44,612 --> 01:19:46,572
We're all going home.

851
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:49,200
Driver, hitch up the horse.
We're going home.

852
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,704
Come on, everyone. We're going home.

853
01:19:52,787 --> 01:19:57,250
- You just gonna leave him up there?
- Yes! Hitch up the horse.

854
01:19:57,333 --> 01:20:00,878
- Whatever you say.
- Dad! Titta!

855
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:03,798
Get your mother. Where's your mother?

856
01:20:03,881 --> 01:20:06,050
- You're leaving him there?
- He's fine up there.

857
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:10,179
- Let's go! I want to go home.
- But he's my son! Aurelio, listen.

858
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:13,766
I want a woman!

859
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:18,021
- Miranda!
- Teo, we're going. Come down!

860
01:20:20,481 --> 01:20:23,276
- But he's sick!
- We're just pretending. Come on!

861
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:27,530
Aurelio, let me climb up.
I'll talk to him.

862
01:20:27,613 --> 01:20:28,740
I'll get him down.

863
01:20:29,115 --> 01:20:30,241
Miranda!

864
01:20:35,246 --> 01:20:37,248
Everyone in the carriage!

865
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,294
We're leaving right now. Get in.

866
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:44,922
Teo, you gonna stay up there?

867
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:46,632
We're going now. It's late.

868
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:51,971
It's getting dark. Who'll take you back?

869
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,097
You gonna stay up there?

870
01:20:53,806 --> 01:20:55,266
All right, then. Bye!

871
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:05,860
Come down!

872
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:16,245
Teo, Holy Mother of God!
Are you gonna come down?

873
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:19,374
We're leaving!

874
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:20,458
Go!

875
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:25,171
- Teo, come down!
- Bye, Uncle!

876
01:21:45,274 --> 01:21:48,403
- I want a woman!
- He'll kill us all today.

877
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:54,575
Come on, everyone out! No questions!

878
01:21:54,659 --> 01:21:56,661
What are you crying about?

879
01:21:56,744 --> 01:21:59,497
You drive to the hospital
and get the attendants.

880
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,417
Hurry, or I'll throw myself down the well!

881
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:06,629
What are you crying about?
It's one big laugh riot!

882
01:22:16,973 --> 01:22:20,393
I want a woman!

883
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,525
Listen to him, Miranda. The poor boy.

884
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,028
Feeling better?

885
01:22:34,365 --> 01:22:40,288
I want a woman!

886
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,133
I can't take it anymore!

887
01:22:52,216 --> 01:22:55,553
- Make him shut up!
- Dad.

888
01:22:56,095 --> 01:22:57,472
What do you want?

889
01:22:57,555 --> 01:22:59,348
Shall I go and get Volpina?

890
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:08,149
Dad, look!

891
01:23:09,775 --> 01:23:11,277
Mama, they're here.

892
01:23:13,988 --> 01:23:16,073
- Evening, Doctor.
- What's happened?

893
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,118
- He's up the tree.
- Nice place.

894
01:23:19,202 --> 01:23:22,705
- Is all this yours?
- It's just an old farm.

895
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:26,542
He's been up there for five hours.

896
01:23:26,626 --> 01:23:29,253
You can't see him now,
because of the foliage.

897
01:23:29,337 --> 01:23:31,464
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing.

898
01:23:31,547 --> 01:23:33,799
He's been shouting and throwing stones.

899
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:37,386
I hope he won't be like this
his whole life, Doctor.

900
01:23:37,470 --> 01:23:39,514
A dwarf nun! Mama!

901
01:23:43,226 --> 01:23:45,520
It'll be bad for him and worse for us.

902
01:23:45,603 --> 01:23:47,605
Don't worry. She'll take care of it.

903
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:50,816
Been getting some fresh air?

904
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,362
Is she going UP?

905
01:23:56,113 --> 01:23:59,784
Come down now! I'm not going
to play these damn silly games!

906
01:24:04,330 --> 01:24:06,832
Jesus, look at that!
She got him right down!

907
01:24:09,168 --> 01:24:12,255
She got him down, and he's all happy.

908
01:24:18,135 --> 01:24:19,512
Here he is.

909
01:24:21,305 --> 01:24:24,141
Up to your tricks again, were you?

910
01:24:24,225 --> 01:24:25,726
What were you doing up there?

911
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:28,813
Counting how many stones
fig trees grow this season.

912
01:24:28,896 --> 01:24:32,191
Go on now. Take him home.

913
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:38,364
Some days he's normal, some days not.
Just like the rest of us.

914
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:42,243
- Bye, Uncle.
- Titta, take care.

915
01:24:47,331 --> 01:24:49,625
You can see Gigino's place from up there.

916
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:52,920
I haven't seen him in so long.

917
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:01,512
Between 11:00 and midnight,
in Caghetta's boat.

918
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:06,267
It's 30 stories high with 16 smokestacks.

919
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:09,770
Think what a pirate could do
with a ship like that.

920
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:41,427
Where's Ronald Colman? I don't see him.

921
01:25:42,261 --> 01:25:43,679
Hooray for Gradisca!

922
01:25:46,515 --> 01:25:48,434
Hello, sister.

923
01:25:48,517 --> 01:25:51,520
Your steamboat. Climb aboard.

924
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,820
Where are all these people going?

925
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:05,618
Where are they going with hearts pounding?

926
01:26:06,869 --> 01:26:10,414
Today is a very important day
for our country, for our fatherland.

927
01:26:10,498 --> 01:26:14,001
Come on, we're off! Come on!

928
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:15,670
İf you drop me, you'll Pay-

929
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:20,299
- I'd like to tell you, but I can't.
- Why not?

930
01:26:20,383 --> 01:26:23,928
Because it's all still up in the air.

931
01:26:24,011 --> 01:26:26,931
Where are all these people going?

932
01:26:27,014 --> 01:26:29,433
Stop busting their balls.

933
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:44,407
How far out will it be?

934
01:26:44,907 --> 01:26:48,828
Four miles. But thanks to Galileo,
it will seem like 400 feet to us.

935
01:26:48,911 --> 01:26:50,079
Marvelous!

936
01:26:50,162 --> 01:26:52,373
It'll seem like
it's coming straight at us.

937
01:27:09,557 --> 01:27:12,226
Mr. Lawyer, how much will it weigh?

938
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:15,855
About two and a half times
the weight of the Grand Hotel.

939
01:27:15,938 --> 01:27:17,732
Plus the Arch of Augustus.

940
01:27:17,815 --> 01:27:21,777
<i>Go thou, Queen of the Sea</i>

941
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:25,698
"Thou passeth, and thy destiny

942
01:27:25,781 --> 01:27:28,617
I shall follow in the waves,

943
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,954
watching your glistening wake."

944
01:27:33,497 --> 01:27:37,084
Move closer to your mother.
Ma'am, move nearer to your son.

945
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:42,631
Holy shit! That water's really freezing!

946
01:27:43,507 --> 01:27:47,178
My nuts have shriveled
to the size of two dried beans.

947
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:51,474
- You swam all the way from the shore?
- Where else?

948
01:27:52,975 --> 01:27:54,101
Freestyle.

949
01:27:58,272 --> 01:28:04,236
<i>I want to dance with you</i>

950
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:08,657
<i>Like this all night</i>

951
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:13,913
The third day, I went out
in my little boat and whistled as usual.

952
01:28:15,122 --> 01:28:18,292
Up jumps the dolphin
near the edge of the boat.

953
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:20,628
He looks at me and says, "Mama."

954
01:28:21,253 --> 01:28:22,254
What a load of bull!

955
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:26,675
No, dolphins are intelligent.
My dentist told me so.

956
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:32,515
Look how many there are.

957
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:36,101
Millions and millions
and millions of stars.

958
01:28:36,185 --> 01:28:37,853
Jesus Christ!

959
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:41,565
I wonder how they all
stay in place up there.

960
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:46,570
I mean, it's pretty simple for us.

961
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:50,115
To build a house,
we use so many bricks, so much lime.

962
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:53,744
But up there, sweet Jesus!
Where do you put the foundations?

963
01:28:54,453 --> 01:28:56,539
They're not made of confetti, you know.

964
01:28:56,622 --> 01:28:58,582
Miranda.

965
01:28:58,666 --> 01:29:01,836
Are you asleep? Answer me.

966
01:29:01,919 --> 01:29:04,004
- Are you cold? Want my jacket?
- What do you want?

967
01:29:04,088 --> 01:29:06,340
- Come on, take my jacket.
- No, I don't want it.

968
01:29:06,423 --> 01:29:09,593
Put it around your shoulders
or you'll start complaining of a chill.

969
01:29:09,677 --> 01:29:13,097
- I know you.
- Have we got much longer to wait?

970
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:15,641
How would I know?
They said around midnight.

971
01:29:15,724 --> 01:29:18,352
But it's coming all the way from America!

972
01:29:19,937 --> 01:29:22,314
Go fuck yourselves, all of you!

973
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:23,816
Some friend, eh?

974
01:29:28,445 --> 01:29:30,281
That's his way of being nice.

975
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:34,869
I was full of hope every time,

976
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:36,996
but it never came to anything.

977
01:29:38,581 --> 01:29:39,999
And now...

978
01:29:40,749 --> 01:29:43,419
- Know how old I am?
Fifty-two?

979
01:29:43,502 --> 01:29:45,754
I'm not ashamed to tell the truth.

980
01:29:45,838 --> 01:29:49,633
In fact, I always add on
a few years. I'm 30.

981
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:52,511
- Hard to believe, my darling.
- I haven't given up hope.

982
01:29:52,595 --> 01:29:55,055
I thought 27 or 28.

983
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:59,977
I want one of those encounters
that last a lifetime.

984
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,273
I want a family, children,

985
01:30:04,356 --> 01:30:10,446
a husband to chat with
in the evening over coffee, maybe,

986
01:30:10,529 --> 01:30:13,824
and to make love with now and then,
because when you must, you must.

987
01:30:14,992 --> 01:30:17,411
But affection is
even more important than love.

988
01:30:18,537 --> 01:30:21,373
And I'm so full of affection.

989
01:30:22,374 --> 01:30:25,336
But who can I give it to?
Who will take it?

990
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:27,338
Why are you crying?

991
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:29,757
The silly girl's crying.

992
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,511
Because she's a delicate
and sensitive girl.

993
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:35,888
Don't cry. I'm here.

994
01:30:35,971 --> 01:30:40,267
- She's right. Men are all the same.
- Don't cry, my darling.

995
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,334
There it is!

996
01:31:05,417 --> 01:31:06,752
Dad!

997
01:31:06,835 --> 01:31:09,838
<i>The Rex!</i>

998
01:31:11,131 --> 01:31:15,678
Hooray for the Rex!
The greatest thing the regime ever built!

999
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:23,018
As the representative of the Podesté,
I wish you a safe journey!

1000
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:24,561
Long live Italy!

1001
01:31:25,479 --> 01:31:27,022
What's it like?

1002
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:15,821
Gina!

1003
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:21,035
Just look at this.

1004
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,920
Can't see a darned thing.

1005
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:36,717
I'll keep to the wall.

1006
01:32:38,552 --> 01:32:41,513
The last fog like this was in '22.

1007
01:32:47,686 --> 01:32:50,898
Careful now! Stop! There's a man here!

1008
01:32:56,195 --> 01:32:58,197
Well, damn it all!

1009
01:33:01,909 --> 01:33:03,118
Gina!

1010
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:12,086
Where am I?

1011
01:33:13,504 --> 01:33:15,506
I don't seem to be anywhere.

1012
01:33:20,302 --> 01:33:22,304
If death is like this,

1013
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:24,973
I don't think much of it.

1014
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,144
Everything's gone:

1015
01:33:29,228 --> 01:33:33,357
people, trees, birds, wine.

1016
01:33:36,110 --> 01:33:37,444
Well, up yours!

1017
01:33:44,993 --> 01:33:46,203
Dino!

1018
01:33:48,413 --> 01:33:51,917
I can't even find my house. Where am I?

1019
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,629
What do you mean?
You're standing right in front of it.

1020
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:11,937
- Where are you going in this fog?
- To school. Bye, Grandpa.

1021
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:15,983
Just think of that.

1022
01:35:34,394 --> 01:35:36,313
I was in Norway.

1023
01:35:36,396 --> 01:35:37,731
Two women.

1024
01:35:38,482 --> 01:35:43,237
Beautiful, huge Norwegians!

1025
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,405
Beans, olives, toasted melon seeds...

1026
01:35:55,707 --> 01:35:57,668
It's open. You can get in.

1027
01:35:58,710 --> 01:36:00,587
Last one in is a queer!

1028
01:36:01,338 --> 01:36:03,882
Naso, get an eyeful of this.

1029
01:36:16,770 --> 01:36:18,188
Look at that!

1030
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:19,898
It's gorgeous!

1031
01:37:18,206 --> 01:37:21,043
Where are you, my love?

1032
01:38:17,057 --> 01:38:20,769
- It was number 18.
- Campari!

1033
01:38:20,852 --> 01:38:23,397
Aldina, wanna know who it was?

1034
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,357
We know. It was Campari.

1035
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,317
I met him at the race in Monza.

1036
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:39,347
Aldina!

1037
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,867
- Lallo, where are you going?
- Be careful!

1038
01:40:00,202 --> 01:40:02,370
- What is it?
- An ear.

1039
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:04,956
Look, an ear!

1040
01:40:21,932 --> 01:40:23,183
May I come in?

1041
01:40:23,975 --> 01:40:27,479
- I'm closed.
- May I come in, miss? Good evening.

1042
01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:29,981
- What do you want?
- A cigarette.

1043
01:40:34,986 --> 01:40:38,156
- May I help you?
- You couldn't manage.

1044
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,824
What do you mean?

1045
01:40:40,325 --> 01:40:43,620
I can lift 175 pounds.
I can even lift my father.

1046
01:40:43,703 --> 01:40:45,247
Don't make me laugh.

1047
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:49,918
- Why? What do you weigh?
- I don't know.

1048
01:40:51,336 --> 01:40:54,422
- I could lift you too.
- Oh, yeah?

1049
01:41:13,441 --> 01:41:14,609
Let's see.

1050
01:41:15,235 --> 01:41:17,779
I really can, you know.

1051
01:41:17,862 --> 01:41:18,863
Let's see.

1052
01:41:24,536 --> 01:41:27,872
Silly boy, put me down!

1053
01:41:29,207 --> 01:41:31,459
- I did it!
- You're very strong.

1054
01:41:31,543 --> 01:41:34,129
See? I can do it again.

1055
01:41:34,212 --> 01:41:35,797
- I don't believe you.
- Watch.

1056
01:41:41,511 --> 01:41:43,054
That's enough now.

1057
01:41:45,515 --> 01:41:47,017
Put me down.

1058
01:41:51,771 --> 01:41:54,858
- You drive me -
- I said that's enough.

1059
01:41:55,900 --> 01:42:01,197
What are you doing?
You'll drop me, you crazy boy!

1060
01:42:02,907 --> 01:42:04,618
You're crazy, you know that?

1061
01:42:05,452 --> 01:42:08,496
What's happened to me? Oh, my head...

1062
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:12,334
See how many times I did it?

1063
01:42:17,631 --> 01:42:20,967
Yes, my little darling.

1064
01:42:21,051 --> 01:42:24,095
Come here. You really are sweet.

1065
01:42:26,598 --> 01:42:31,645
Drive me crazy... just a little.

1066
01:42:31,728 --> 01:42:34,481
- What should I do?
- Suck.

1067
01:42:35,398 --> 01:42:36,650
Come on.

1068
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:43,990
You can have this one, too.

1069
01:42:44,866 --> 01:42:47,744
Don't blow! Suck!

1070
01:42:47,827 --> 01:42:49,329
Is this right?

1071
01:42:54,793 --> 01:42:57,420
You have to suck, you idiot!

1072
01:42:57,504 --> 01:42:59,547
- What are you doing?
- I can't breathe!

1073
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,342
Forget about it.

1074
01:43:02,884 --> 01:43:04,886
Go on now. I have to close up.

1075
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:09,641
What was it you wanted? A cigarette?

1076
01:43:09,724 --> 01:43:12,769
It's on me. Now scram.

1077
01:43:20,902 --> 01:43:23,238
- I can't lift it.
- Out of the way.

1078
01:43:26,449 --> 01:43:28,535
Go on. Get out.

1079
01:43:28,618 --> 01:43:29,786
Good night.

1080
01:43:36,876 --> 01:43:38,712
Drink it. It'll do you good.

1081
01:43:39,254 --> 01:43:42,006
- It's hot!
- It's supposed to be.

1082
01:43:59,899 --> 01:44:01,401
There's a fly in here.

1083
01:44:01,484 --> 01:44:04,487
- Where?
- There...

1084
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:06,114
It was there.

1085
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:10,618
The only house with flies in the winter.

1086
01:44:13,455 --> 01:44:15,331
How did it happen with you and Dad?

1087
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:17,459
How did what happen?

1088
01:44:17,542 --> 01:44:22,130
How'd you meet, fall in love, get married?

1089
01:44:25,341 --> 01:44:27,051
What's all this about?

1090
01:44:27,844 --> 01:44:30,013
And who remembers anyway?

1091
01:44:30,096 --> 01:44:33,433
Your dad's not a great one
for compliments.

1092
01:44:33,516 --> 01:44:36,686
He was a laborer at Saludecio.

1093
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:41,691
My folks had a bit of money
and didn't think much of him.

1094
01:44:42,817 --> 01:44:45,653
So... well...

1095
01:44:46,905 --> 01:44:51,451
we eloped without a word to anyone.

1096
01:44:52,494 --> 01:44:54,954
When did he give you the first kiss?

1097
01:44:55,914 --> 01:44:58,541
What kind of question is that?

1098
01:44:59,834 --> 01:45:02,587
I don't even know if there was one.

1099
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:07,383
The first time we met,
he raised his hat, and that was all.

1100
01:45:08,468 --> 01:45:11,221
It was the most
one could do in those days.

1101
01:45:11,304 --> 01:45:16,518
It's not like now,
when all kinds of things go on.

1102
01:45:16,601 --> 01:45:18,812
But I never manage to do anything, Mama!

1103
01:45:18,895 --> 01:45:21,064
Keep those covers on. You're all sweaty.

1104
01:45:21,147 --> 01:45:24,192
What do you mean "manage"?
You're still in short pants.

1105
01:45:24,275 --> 01:45:28,321
Get me some long ones then,
like the other kids!

1106
01:45:28,404 --> 01:45:29,989
What others?

1107
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,157
Gina!

1108
01:45:31,658 --> 01:45:35,119
She told me I wasn't to send
any more love letters.

1109
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:37,997
- Ma'am?
- Take the bike and get the doctor.

1110
01:45:38,081 --> 01:45:39,290
Yes, ma'am.

1111
01:45:39,374 --> 01:45:42,210
Get him to examine you too.
You scared me the other day.

1112
01:45:42,293 --> 01:45:43,545
Run along.

1113
01:45:46,756 --> 01:45:51,219
But I'll send letters whenever I like.

1114
01:45:55,306 --> 01:45:56,808
Africa.

1115
01:45:56,891 --> 01:45:59,352
<i>- I'll</i> become a doctor and go to Africa.
- Yes.

1116
01:45:59,435 --> 01:46:01,896
- That'll teach her.
- Yes.

1117
01:46:14,909 --> 01:46:17,203
It's snowing outside!

1118
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:28,923
It's true! It's snowing!

1119
01:46:31,885 --> 01:46:33,803
Professor Fighetta, up yours!

1120
01:46:34,596 --> 01:46:37,599
If it goes on like this,
there'll be no school for days.

1121
01:46:38,266 --> 01:46:40,977
Look, the mountains are all white!

1122
01:46:41,060 --> 01:46:44,063
Let's go and see the snow on the water.

1123
01:46:44,147 --> 01:46:46,399
Too moist. It'll never stick.

1124
01:46:55,992 --> 01:46:58,620
Go away. Get the hell out of here.

1125
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:25,063
Stay where you are.

1126
01:47:26,189 --> 01:47:27,690
The sparrows!

1127
01:47:52,256 --> 01:47:55,009
- Wait, I'm coming with you.
- Hurry up.

1128
01:48:08,606 --> 01:48:10,942
Titta, look how it's coming down!

1129
01:48:14,737 --> 01:48:16,155
Let's open the window.

1130
01:48:17,615 --> 01:48:18,992
It's beautiful!

1131
01:48:23,454 --> 01:48:24,455
Me too!

1132
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:30,920
Still snowing.

1133
01:48:31,004 --> 01:48:34,424
Four days this goddamn stuffs
been around!

1134
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:45,977
This will go down
as the Year of the Big Snow.

1135
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:48,146
With the exception of the Ice Age,

1136
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:53,568
it's never snowed
this heavily in our town.

1137
01:48:57,739 --> 01:49:01,617
That must've been some young boy,
not the usual guy.

1138
01:49:01,701 --> 01:49:05,038
As I was saying,
the exceptional years were

1139
01:49:05,121 --> 01:49:08,624
1541, 1694,

1140
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:11,878
1728 and 1888,

1141
01:49:11,961 --> 01:49:16,549
when, against all odds,
it snowed on July 13th.

1142
01:49:43,326 --> 01:49:45,244
You'll make us all deaf, idiot!

1143
01:50:03,429 --> 01:50:04,597
Where is she?

1144
01:50:14,107 --> 01:50:15,775
How's your mother?

1145
01:50:17,110 --> 01:50:18,694
Better now.

1146
01:50:19,612 --> 01:50:22,824
She's still in the hospital,
but she's off the critical list.

1147
01:50:22,907 --> 01:50:28,496
That's good - the poor woman.
Give her my regards.

1148
01:50:28,579 --> 01:50:30,248
Your mother's a kind lady.

1149
01:50:30,331 --> 01:50:35,253
She always gave me soup and wine.

1150
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,171
A kind lady.

1151
01:51:13,082 --> 01:51:14,250
How are you feeling?

1152
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:19,046
- I brought you carnations.
- Thank you. How are you?

1153
01:51:20,423 --> 01:51:21,757
Hello, Aurelio.

1154
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,051
They're lovely.

1155
01:51:24,677 --> 01:51:28,598
I was just looking out the window.
Now I'll go back to bed.

1156
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:30,975
But I'm feeling better today.

1157
01:51:31,058 --> 01:51:32,560
What lovely colors.

1158
01:51:33,311 --> 01:51:35,605
- Aren't you hot with this on?
- Thank you.

1159
01:51:35,688 --> 01:51:37,356
<i>- I'll</i> put it here.
- Have you eaten?

1160
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,066
- We've eaten.
- Yes.

1161
01:51:55,499 --> 01:51:57,960
Are you still getting
on your father's nerves?

1162
01:51:58,044 --> 01:52:00,213
He pounds me over the head!

1163
01:52:01,005 --> 01:52:03,382
He'll beat all the sense out of me!

1164
01:52:13,768 --> 01:52:17,104
They have a nice garden here.
I didn't know.

1165
01:52:18,022 --> 01:52:20,316
It looks as though it's in bloom,
with the snow.

1166
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:22,485
Mama, it's still snowing.

1167
01:52:24,695 --> 01:52:27,698
In one sense, you're lucky to be here,

1168
01:52:27,782 --> 01:52:31,285
all warm in bed, with this weather.

1169
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:36,916
The poor man's tired when he gets home.

1170
01:52:36,999 --> 01:52:39,210
Don't talk back to him.
You're a grown-up now.

1171
01:52:42,213 --> 01:52:45,883
Don't throw ice! It hurts!

1172
01:52:49,887 --> 01:52:53,307
"Wind and rain, go home again.
I don't want to feel the pain."

1173
01:52:54,475 --> 01:52:56,310
Idiot! No!

1174
01:53:03,401 --> 01:53:05,403
A difficult shot, Your Excellency!

1175
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:08,447
Gradisca!

1176
01:53:15,454 --> 01:53:17,123
No! Not at Gradisca!

1177
01:53:22,878 --> 01:53:24,672
Enough! I surrender!

1178
01:53:28,634 --> 01:53:32,305
Break my windows
and I'll crack your skulls open!

1179
01:53:37,018 --> 01:53:38,436
Who's that?

1180
01:53:45,443 --> 01:53:46,944
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1181
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:58,331
Look, it's the count's peacock!

1182
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:02,084
There it is.

1183
01:54:02,918 --> 01:54:04,170
It's coming down.

1184
01:54:12,636 --> 01:54:14,263
Shall we catch it, boys?

1185
01:54:21,979 --> 01:54:23,689
Holy shit!

1186
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:33,616
I don't understand. What's happened?

1187
01:54:33,699 --> 01:54:36,077
I'll tell you in the car, Uncle.

1188
01:54:36,702 --> 01:54:39,663
Why in the car? Where are we going?

1189
01:54:39,747 --> 01:54:43,000
Close by. To Aunt Zaira's farm.

1190
01:54:43,084 --> 01:54:46,253
A relative's come from America
and wants to say hello to you.

1191
01:54:46,837 --> 01:54:50,633
Then why doesn't he come here?

1192
01:54:50,716 --> 01:54:52,343
Who is this relative?

1193
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:22,164
Auntie died.

1194
01:55:28,879 --> 01:55:31,090
Be strong.

1195
01:55:36,262 --> 01:55:37,763
Titta, no!

1196
01:55:39,598 --> 01:55:42,059
Don't take it like that. Open up, Titta.

1197
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:47,565
- Open up.
- No, I won't!

1198
01:56:13,299 --> 01:56:16,051
- Lallo!
- He fainted!

1199
01:56:16,135 --> 01:56:18,220
Uncle's not feeling good.

1200
01:56:22,016 --> 01:56:24,310
Then take him to the whorehouse.

1201
01:56:28,772 --> 01:56:30,566
Make the sign of the cross, Dad.

1202
01:56:53,255 --> 01:56:55,674
- How do you feel now?
- Better.

1203
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:01,347
Don't take it so hard. Be strong.

1204
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:32,962
Everybody in line now.
Where are the orphans?

1205
01:58:41,614 --> 01:58:43,032
Stop that!

1206
02:00:16,709 --> 02:00:18,919
Hooray for the bride and groom!

1207
02:00:21,714 --> 02:00:23,465
Give me your arm, Naso.

1208
02:00:24,299 --> 02:00:28,721
Make way, make way!
My breasts are full of milk!

1209
02:00:30,347 --> 02:00:36,061
"'Bride and groom' or 'newlyweds,'
whatever they may call ya,

1210
02:00:36,145 --> 02:00:39,481
here's hoping you find wedded bliss
in far-off Battipaglia."

1211
02:00:39,565 --> 02:00:42,359
When you're drunk, you can even rhyme!

1212
02:00:47,156 --> 02:00:50,159
<i>Gradisca's getting married and going away</i>

1213
02:00:52,578 --> 02:00:57,791
Sorry if we got on your nerves.
We hate to see you go.

1214
02:01:00,461 --> 02:01:02,212
We're really going to miss you!

1215
02:01:07,468 --> 02:01:10,053
"Silence is golden,
but words are like jewels.

1216
02:01:10,137 --> 02:01:13,390
May this married couple
live happy as fools!"

1217
02:01:13,474 --> 02:01:15,893
- Where's the bride?
- Straight ahead.

1218
02:01:15,976 --> 02:01:21,231
Our Gradisca is leaving us.
She found her Gary Cooper.

1219
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:24,777
Though Gary Cooper's a cowboy,
while Matteo is a carabiniere.

1220
02:01:24,860 --> 02:01:28,447
But love is love all the same.
Good luck, Gradisca.

1221
02:01:29,698 --> 02:01:31,950
Long live the bride and groom!

1222
02:01:32,034 --> 02:01:35,537
You have fulfilled your dream of love.

1223
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:40,501
Now it's your happy duty
to have many children

1224
02:01:40,584 --> 02:01:44,379
for your family, for the church
and for your country!

1225
02:01:46,757 --> 02:01:51,178
"Gathered here at the drinking trough,
here's one more toast to send them off!"

1226
02:01:53,806 --> 02:01:58,644
A picture! We're gonna take pictures now.

1227
02:01:59,228 --> 02:02:00,604
Give me your mirror.

1228
02:02:01,897 --> 02:02:04,399
Everybody get behind the bride!

1229
02:02:05,025 --> 02:02:07,277
She's lovely, our Ninola!

1230
02:02:07,361 --> 02:02:09,988
- Why are you crying?
- I'm not crying anymore.

1231
02:02:10,447 --> 02:02:12,032
Get closer together.

1232
02:02:12,115 --> 02:02:14,451
The carabiniere should move back a little.

1233
02:02:15,869 --> 02:02:17,871
Stand in the light.

1234
02:02:17,955 --> 02:02:20,749
- Hold it.
- Hey, it's raining.

1235
02:02:21,375 --> 02:02:23,961
Smile...

1236
02:02:24,044 --> 02:02:26,129
There! One more.

1237
02:02:26,213 --> 02:02:28,215
gangway!

1238
02:02:28,298 --> 02:02:31,468
Stop falling all over us, you drunkard!

1239
02:02:33,345 --> 02:02:36,932
Let's move into the sun. Everyone up.

1240
02:02:37,015 --> 02:02:40,018
Everybody follow me.

1241
02:02:40,519 --> 02:02:44,523
Over here with the bride in the center
and the carabiniere...

1242
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:48,986
I've made up another rhyme,
and it goes like this:

1243
02:02:49,069 --> 02:02:52,990
"Though the world may be full
of things beautiful and dear,

1244
02:02:53,073 --> 02:02:56,785
of towns even nicer
and prettier than here -"

1245
02:02:56,869 --> 02:03:00,330
A little water will do you good.
You'll have a bath for once.

1246
02:03:00,414 --> 02:03:01,707
Get up.

1247
02:03:02,791 --> 02:03:05,627
It stopped.

1248
02:03:05,711 --> 02:03:07,963
Sit down and play!

1249
02:03:08,046 --> 02:03:10,716
A wet bride is a lucky bride.

1250
02:03:15,929 --> 02:03:17,097
Long live Italy!

1251
02:03:25,022 --> 02:03:30,694
How will you live so far from here?

1252
02:03:32,362 --> 02:03:34,990
Goodbye to you all. Go home.

1253
02:03:36,909 --> 02:03:38,744
Biscein bids you goodbye.

1254
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:52,007
Naso, I'm going home!

1255
02:03:54,134 --> 02:03:57,346
Wait for me! I'm coming with you!

1256
02:04:21,036 --> 02:04:23,330
Wait! My bouquet!

1257
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:27,167
Goodbye! I love you all!

1258
02:04:30,003 --> 02:04:31,421
Gradisca's taking off!

1259
02:04:32,506 --> 02:04:33,882
She's leaving.

1260
02:04:33,966 --> 02:04:36,551
- Good bye!
- Good bye, Gradisca!

1261
02:05:07,666 --> 02:05:09,376
The puffballs!

1262
02:05:16,091 --> 02:05:17,718
Titta!

1263
02:05:19,386 --> 02:05:21,054
Where's Titta?

1264
02:05:21,722 --> 02:05:23,932
Shall we go fishing in the harbor?

1265
02:05:26,768 --> 02:05:30,230
Titta left a while ago.
